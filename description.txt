This RESTful API is based off of the description given in example #2. The purpose of the software is to allow users to request rides, either immediately or schedule them at a certain time. There are two paths/POST requests. These requests require similar information, except one of them requires a date and time (scheduled event) and the other doesn't (immediate event). The other information required for each path is an ID, name, location, destination, and the number of passengers. An estimated peak number of concurrent events is around 12,500. Users of the system include those sending requests and those receiving requests (being notified).
